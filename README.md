# Light-Probe-Generator
A tool for unity to generate light probes

Can set size density of volume to generate probes.
Had distance function so if the sample point is further than a set ammount away from any geometry it wont generate a point

!this abslutley HATES concave colliders!


feel free to do whatever you please with this, I cloundnt care less.
